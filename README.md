### Details

Playing around to learn about how to work with timezones. It was inspired by working with 
people on the West Coast of the States and all over Europe, while I'm in Melbourne, Australia.
This is always an issue especially when the time changes. This will be used to add a timezone
feature to SolidOS.

### ToDo

1. Need to work on styling
2. Need to test properly
3. Wording needs updating because in the end I had to use Luxon not Momentum because it is deprecated.
