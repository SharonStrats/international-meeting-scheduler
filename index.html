    <h1>International Meeting Scheduler</h1>
    <p>Have you ever encountered the difficulties of scheduling 
        a meeting with people from all over the world. Or what about
        when you thought you had finally found the perfect time and 
        all of a sudden you're approaching Daylight Savings Time and 
        the confusion starts all over again. 
    </p>

    <p>Well, funny enough, not only is this a difficult coordination
        problem, it is also a hard problem to solve technically.</p>

    <p>If you have been spending way too much time lately on the couch
        watching Netflix and want to give your brain a workout 
        or you are a bit of a nerd like me and find everything complicated 
        just one more challenge you must undertake, you can read 
        <a href="https://toastui.medium.com/handling-time-zone-in-javascript-547e67aa842d">this</a>
    </p>
    <p>And if you want to get straight to the punchline and schedule 
        a meeting I don't blame you one bit.....
    </p>
    <p>The reason why the problem is difficult is because not only 
        do many countries have multiple timezones within it, many
        timezones change for summer hours. And this is a big world 
        and therefore a big list of if/else statements..... but thankfully
        there is a library called <a href="https://momentjs.com/timezone/docs/moment-timezone.">moment-timezone</a> 
    </p>
